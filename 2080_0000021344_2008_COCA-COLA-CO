company measures the volume of products sold in two ways one unit cases of finished products and two concentrate sales as used in this report unit case means a unit of measurement equal to s fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings and unit case volume means the number of unit cases or unit case equivalents of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners coca cola system to customers unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to or distributed by our company and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit such products licensed to or distributed by our company or owned by coca cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume in addition unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest although most of our company s revenues are not based directly on unit case volume we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level the unit case volume numbers used in this report are based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates syrups beverage bases and powders in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases sold by or used in finished beverages sold by the company to its bottling partners or other customers concentrate sales replaced the gallon sales concept beginning with the first quarter of we made this change primarily to replace equivalent gallons with equivalent unit cases as a unit of measurement for concentrates syrups beverage bases and powders which better reflects how our company conducts its operations most of our revenues are based on concentrate sales a primarily wholesale activity unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period items such as seasonality bottlers inventory practices supply point changes timing of price increases new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates in concentrates and syrups for beverages bearing the trademark coca cola or any trademark that includes coca cola or coke

marketing capabilities around the world these investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume net revenues and profits at the bottler level which in turn generate increased concentrate sales for our company s concentrate and syrup business when this occurs both table of contents we and our bottling partners benefit from long term growth in volume improved cash flows and increased shareowner value the level of our investment generally depends on the bottler s capital structure and its available resources at the time of the investment historically in certain situations we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation often on a temporary basis owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler s sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler s business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures in line with our long term bottling strategy we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler one such option is to combine our bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances another option is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our equity method investee bottlers in both of these situations our company continues to participate in the bottler s results of operations through our share of the strategic business alliances or equity method investees

our principal raw material the citrus industry is subject to the variability of weather conditions in particular freezing weather or hurricanes in central florida may result in shortages and higher

numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business in many jurisdictions compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions the production distribution and sale in the united states of many of our company s products are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal trade commission act the lanham act state consumer protection laws federal state and local workplace health and safety laws various federal state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production transportation sale safety advertising labeling and ingredients of such products outside the united states the production distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations a california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects the law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products this is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required consequently even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement no company beverages produced for sale in california are currently required to display warnings under this law we are unable to predict whether a component found in a company product might be added to the california list in the future although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine will be evaluated for listing furthermore we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist or as they may be amended might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a company beverage produced for sale in california bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use nonrefillable recyclable containers in the united states and various other markets around the world some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers which are also recyclable legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the united states and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary other types of beverage container related deposit

around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater our policy is to comply
