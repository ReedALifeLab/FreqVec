concentrates sometimes referred to as beverage bases syrups finished beverages and powders in all cases expressed in equivalent gallons of syrup for all beverage products which are reportable as unit case volume most of our revenues are based on this measure of primarily wholesale activity we also measure volume in unit cases as used in this report unit case means a unit of measurement equal to s fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings and unit case volume of the company means the number of unit cases or unit case equivalents of company trademark or licensed beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the coca cola bottling system or by the company to customers unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to our company or brands owned by coca cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from which it derives income from the sales such products licensed to our company or owned by coca cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume although most of our company s revenues are not based directly on unit case volume we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level the unit case volume numbers used in this report are based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors gallon sales and unit case volume are not necessarily equal during any given period items such as seasonality bottlers inventory practices supply point changes timing of price increases and new product introductions can create differences between gallon sales and unit case volume

significant equity investments and company bottling operations our company maintains business relationships with three types of bottlers owned bottlers in which the company has no ownership interest

juice juice drink sports drink and other finished beverage operations make equity investments in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the coca cola system s production distribution and marketing systems around the world these investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume net revenues and profits at the bottler level which in turn generate increased gallon sales for our company s concentrate business when this occurs both we and our bottling partners benefit from long term growth in volume improved cash flows and increased shareowner level of our investment generally depends on the bottler s capital structure and its available resources at the time of the investment historically in certain situations we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation often on a temporary basis owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler s sales and programs and assist in the development of the bottler s business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures line with our long term bottling strategy we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler one such option is to combine our bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances another option is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our equity investee bottlers in both of these situations our company continues to participate in the bottler s results of operations through our share of the equity investee s earnings or losses cases where our investments in bottlers represent noncontrolling interests our intention is to provide expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses investees that we account for by the equity method include the following coca cola enterprises inc our

negative aspects of our competitive position include strong competition in all geographical regions and in many countries a concentrated retail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose between company products products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers own store brand raw materials the principal raw materials used by our business are nutritive and non nutritive sweeteners in the united states the principal nutritive sweetener is high fructose corn syrup a form of sugar that is available from numerous domestic sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price the principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the united states is sucrose another form of sugar that is also available from numerous sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price our company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for sweeteners in the united states we purchase our requirements of high fructose corn syrup with the assistance of coca cola bottlers sales services company llc ccbss ccbss is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized coca cola bottlers doing business in the united states among other things ccbss provides procurement services to our company for the purchase of various goods and services in the united states including high fructose

other important non nutritive sweeteners such as saccharin or acesulfame potassium in our low calorie soft drink products is currently purchased by us primarily from the nutrasweet company holland sweetener company and ajinomoto co inc which we consider to be our only viable sources for the supply of this product acesulfame potassium is currently purchased from nutrinova nutrition specialties food ingredients gmbh which we consider to be our only viable source for the supply of this product our company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for sweeteners company sells a number of products sweetened with sucralose a noncaloric sweetener and we plan on offering our customers a larger number of new products with sucralose in we work closely with tate lyle our sucralose supplier to maintain continuity of supply although tate lyle is our single source for sucralose we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining our requirements for sucralose regard to juice and juice drink products the citrus industry is subject to the variability of weather conditions this includes in particular the possibility of freezes in central florida which may result in higher prices and therefore lower consumer demand for orange juice throughout the industry due to our ability to source orange juice concentrate from the southern hemisphere particularly from brazil the supply of juice available that meets the company s standards is normally adequate to meet demand patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks our company owns numerous patents copyrights and trade secrets as well as substantial know how and technology which we collectively refer to in this report as technology this technology generally relates to our company s

included in the company s bottler s agreements the company has registered and licenses the right to use its trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise in addition to nonalcoholic beverages governmental regulation our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business in many jurisdictions compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions production distribution and sale in the united states of many of the company s products are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the occupational safety and health act the lanham act various environmental statutes and various other federal state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production transportation sale safety advertising labeling and ingredients of such products outside the united states the production distribution and sales of our many products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects the law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products this is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required consequently even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement no company beverage products are currently required to display warnings under this law however we are unable to predict whether a component found in a company product might be added to the california list in the future furthermore we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist or as may be amended might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a company product of our beverage products presently offer non refillable recyclable containers in the united states and various other markets around the world some of these bottlers also offer refillable containers which are also recyclable legal requirements have been enacted in jurisdictions in the united states and overseas requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale marketing and use of certain non refillable beverage containers the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary other beverage container related deposit recycling ecotax and or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the united states and overseas we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local state and federal levels both in the united states and elsewhere of our company s facilities in the united states and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental laws and regulations compliance with these provisions has not had and we do not expect such compliance to have any material adverse effect on our company s capital expenditures net income or competitive position as of december our company employed approximately persons compared to approximately at the end of the increase in the number of employees was primarily due to the consolidation of variable interest entities mainly in africa offset by the decrease due to the deconsolidation of certain bottling operations at the end of approximately company employees were located
