concentrate business when this occurs both the company and the bottlers benefit from long term growth in volume improved cash flows and increased share owner value the level of our company s investment generally depends on the bottler s capital structure and its available resources at the time of the investment historically in certain situations the company has viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation owning such a controlling interest has allowed the company to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled the company to help focus the bottler s sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler s business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures in separate

of paresa shares by our company in january in line with its long term bottling strategy our company periodically considers options for reducing its ownership interest in a bottler one such option is to combine the company s bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances another option is to sell the company s interest in a bottling operation to one of the company s equity investee bottlers in both of these situations our company continues participating in the bottler s results of operations through its share of the equity investee s earnings or losses in cases where the company s investments in bottlers represent noncontrolling interests our company s intention is to provide expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses during the

plus cash in exchange for a equity interest in the joint venture our company views certain bottling operations in which the company has a noncontrolling ownership interest as key or anchor bottlers due to their level of responsibility and performance the strong commitment of both key and anchor bottlers to their own profitable volume growth helps our company meet its strategic goals and furthers the interests of its worldwide production distribution and marketing systems these bottlers tend to be large and geographically diverse with strong financial resources for long term investment and

law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects the law exposes all food and beverage
