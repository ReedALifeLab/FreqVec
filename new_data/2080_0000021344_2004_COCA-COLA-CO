the establishment of appropriate capital structures line with our long term bottling strategy we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler one such option is

investee bottlers in both of these situations our company continues to participate in the bottler s results of operations through its share of the equity investee s earnings or losses cases where our

competitive position in those jurisdictions production distribution and sale in the united states of many of the company s products are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the occupational safety and health act the lanham act various environmental statutes and various other federal state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production transportation sale safety advertising labeling and ingredients of such products california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects the law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products this is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required consequently even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement no company beverage products are currently required to display warnings under this law however we are unable to predict whether an important component of a company product might be added to the california list in the future we are also unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of company beverage products of our beverage products presently offer nonrefillable recyclable containers in all areas of the united states and canada some of these bottlers also offer refillable containers which are also recyclable measures have been enacted in various localities and states which require that a deposit be charged for certain non refillable beverage containers the precise requirements imposed by these measures vary other deposit recycling or
