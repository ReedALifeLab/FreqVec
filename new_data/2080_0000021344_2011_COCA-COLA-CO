syrups in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases sold by or used in finished beverages sold by the company to its bottling partners or other customers unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period factors such as seasonality bottlers inventory practices supply point changes timing of price increases new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales volume and can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates in addition to the items mentioned above the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest but to which the company does not sell concentrates or syrups may give rise
