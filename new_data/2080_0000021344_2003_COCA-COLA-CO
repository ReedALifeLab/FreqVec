the bottlers benefit from long term growth in volume improved cash flows and increased share owner value the level of our investment generally depends on the bottler s capital structure and its available resources at the time of the investment historically in certain situations we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation often on a temporary basis owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler s sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler s business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital structures in line with our long term bottling strategy we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler one such option is to combine our bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances another option is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our equity investee bottlers in both of these situations our company continues to participate in the bottler s results of operations through its

those of its competitors raw materials the principal raw material used by our business in the united states is high fructose corn syrup a form of sugar which is available from numerous domestic sources and is historically subject to fluctuations in its market price the principal raw material used by our business outside the united states is sucrose our company has a specialized sweetener procurement staff and has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements in the united states and certain other countries we have authorized the use of high fructose corn syrup for

primarily from the nutrasweet company and from holland sweetener acesulfame potassium is currently purchased from nutrinova nutrition specialties food ingredients gmbh with regard to juice and juice drink products the citrus industry is subject to the variability of weather conditions this includes in particular the possibility of freezes in central florida which may result in higher prices and lower consumer demand for orange juice throughout the industry due to our long standing relationship with a supplier of high quality brazilian orange juice concentrate the supply of juice available that meets the company s standards is normally adequate to meet demand patents trade secrets trademarks and copyrights our company is the owner of numerous patents copyrights and trade secrets as well

is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business in many jurisdictions compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those the production distribution and sale in the united states of many of the company s products are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the occupational safety and health act the lanham act various environmental statutes and various other federal state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production transportation sale safety advertising labeling and ingredients of such products a california law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects the law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products this is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required consequently even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement no company beverage products are currently required to display warnings under this law however we are unable to predict whether an important component of a company product might be added to the california list in the future we are also unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of company beverage products bottlers of our beverage products presently offer non refillable recyclable containers in all areas of the united states and canada some of these bottlers also offer refillable containers which are also recyclable measures have been enacted in various localities and states which require that a deposit be charged for certain
