dispenser in selected locations in the united states coca cola freestyle allows consumers to select from more than different regular and low calorie branded beverages including a variety of still beverages measure the volume of company beverage products sold in two ways one unit cases of finished products and two concentrate sales as used in this report unit case means a unit of measurement equal to s fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings and unit case volume means the number of unit cases or unit case equivalents of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners the coca cola system to customers unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to or distributed by our company and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive economic benefit such products licensed to or distributed by our company and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of our total unit case volume in addition unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest although most of our company s revenues are not based directly on unit case volume we believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the coca cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level the unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the company from its bottling partners and distributors concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates and syrups in all cases expressed in equivalent unit cases sold by or used in finished beverages sold by the company to its bottling partners or other customers most of our revenues are based on concentrate sales a primarily wholesale activity unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period factors such as seasonality bottlers inventory practices supply point changes timing of price increases new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and concentrate sales and create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates in addition to the items mentioned above the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the company has an equity interest but to which the company does not sell concentrates or syrups may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales growth rates the coca cola system sold approximately billion billion and billion unit cases of our products in and respectively sparkling

conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities we may provide promotional and marketing services or funds to our bottlers in most cases we do this on a discretionary basis under

entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated company trademark beverages from the company or company authorized suppliers we typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing

reserve for ourselves or our designee the right one to prepare and package such beverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory and two to prepare package distribute and

ownership or control of the bottler certain parts of the world outside the united states we have not granted comprehensive beverage production rights to the bottlers in such instances we or our authorized suppliers sell company trademark beverages to the bottlers for sale and distribution throughout the designated territory often on a nonexclusive basis a majority of the bottler s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the united states authorize the bottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups usually on a nonexclusive basis company generally has complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to bottlers outside the united states in some instances however we have agreed or may in the future agree with a bottler with respect to concentrate pricing on a prospective basis for specified time periods in some markets in an effort to allow our company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value aligned incentives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers always changing needs and tastes we worked with our bottling partners to develop and implement an incidence based pricing model for sparkling and still beverages under this model the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to bottler pricing the channels in which the finished products are sold and package mix outside the united states in most cases we have no obligation to provide marketing support to the bottlers nevertheless we may at our discretion contribute toward bottler expenditures for advertising and marketing we may also elect to undertake independent or cooperative advertising and marketing activities within the united states in the

wholesalers in turn sell the syrups or deliver them on our behalf to restaurants and other retailers the united states the form of bottler s agreement for cola flavored sparkling beverages that covers the largest amount of u s concentrate sales the contract gives us complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups for company trademark beverages in some

trademark coca cola beverages and other cola flavored company trademark beverages with pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price this baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the company up to a maximum indexed ceiling price and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices as applicable bottlers accounting for the remaining approximately threepercent of u s bottle can concentrate sales in operate under our oldest form of contract which provides for a fixed price for coca cola syrup used in bottles and cans this price is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the quoted price of sugar have standard contracts with bottlers in the united states for the sale of concentrates and syrups for non cola flavored sparkling

package mix we expect to use an incidence based pricing model in for most of our bottlers operating under the contract the contract and most of our other standard beverage contracts with bottlers in the united states our company has no obligation to participate with bottlers in expenditures for advertising and marketing nevertheless at our discretion we may contribute toward such expenditures and undertake independent or cooperative advertising and marketing activities some u s bottler s agreements that predate the contract impose certain marketing obligations on us with respect to certain company trademark beverages a practical matter our company s ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of its syrups concentrates and finished beverages under various agreements described above is subject both outside and within the united states to competitive market conditions significant equity method investments and company bottling operations our company maintains business relationships with three types of bottlers bottlers in which the company has no ownership interest bottlers in which the company has invested and has a noncontrolling ownership interest and bottlers in which the company has invested and has a controlling ownership interest bottling operations in which we had no ownership interest produced and

finished beverage operations make equity investments in selected bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the coca cola system s production distribution and marketing capabilities around the world these investments are to result in increases in unit case volume net revenues and profits at the bottler level which in turn generate increased concentrate sales for our company s concentrate and syrup business when this occurs both we and our bottling partners benefit from long term growth in volume improved cash flows and increased shareowner value level of our investment generally depends on the bottler s capital structure and its available resources at the time of the investment historically in certain situations we have viewed it as advantageous to acquire a controlling interest in a bottling operation often on a temporary basis owning such a controlling interest has allowed us to compensate for limited local resources and has enabled us to help focus the bottler s sales and marketing programs and assist in the development of the bottler s business and information systems and the establishment of appropriate capital line with our long term bottling strategy we may periodically consider options for reducing our ownership interest in a bottler one such option is to combine our bottling interests with the bottling interests of others to form strategic business alliances another option is to sell our interest in a bottling operation to one of our equity method investee bottlers in both of these situations our company continues to participate in the bottler s results of operations through our share of the strategic business alliances or equity method investees earnings or losses cases where our investments
